            <h3 id="journey-subtitle">Where i started</h3>
            <p>2 years into my 4 year course studying physics at university i concluded that it wasn't where i wanted to take my career, i was enjoying the content but knew that it wasn't for me in the long run
              and i'd be spending increasingly more time helping a friend with his programming modules, i began learning that almost addictively! I'd
              developed a huge passion for it over the few months i'd been learning and i knew thats where i wanted to be career wise. After considering my options and looking into junior roles and apprenticeships in
              software development i made the leap and withdrew from my studies, got a part time job in retail and began teaching myself HTML and CSS. I bought an online Web Development course and have been transfixed ever
              since !
            </p>

            <img class="mx-auto" src="images/computer.png" alt="" id="comp">
            <h3 id="journey-subtitle">Where i am now</h3>
            <p>Still learning ! I've been studying HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and vanilla javascript. I've built a simple dice game as a project to put what i've learned in JS into practice which you can
               see<a class="" href="https://con-grieves.github.io/Dice/" target="_blank"><i></i> Here.</a> I'm loving it and have invested in a number of online courses on the topic to take my learning further.
              I try to spend as much time as i can studying via online courses and applying what i learn into little projects such as this site. I'm keen to take the next step
              and get my foot in the door in a professional environment, i'm excited to get started !

            <h3 id="journey-subtitle">Where i want to be</h3>
            <p><em>Still learning.</em> I don't expect to ever stop learning whilst pursuing this career path, it's constantly developing and i understand that adpatation is key to staying upto-date with technology trends. Software development is where my passion
              lies
              and learning more langauges and developing my problem solving skills whilst working alongside seasoned developers is exactly why
               i'm so excited to begin my journey and kickstart my passion into a career.
              My long-term goal is to continue pursuing Software Development and land a job within a team as a junior dev, working my way up and learning as i go, diving headfirst into growing myself as a developer.

       <div class="why">
        <h2 class="get-in-touch" id='Aln'>Why i've applied for an Apprenticeship</h2>

        <h3 class='hthree'>Getting started with my dream career</h3>
        <p class='subh'>I believe this apprenticeship is the perfect way to kickstart my career in software development because it aligns perfectly with where i want to be within the industry, i’d be working on technologies i’m already passionate about and would have the chance to learn in a structured, proffessional environment whilst gaining critical industry experience learning agile team principles and how to work within a development team.

        <h3 class="hthree">Learning how to work in the industry</h3>
        <p class="subh">One aspect of the apprenticeship which really excites me is the opportunity to work within a digital team and learn what it means to work on digital systems within a team, getting to know best practices and learn crucial skills that will be the foundation for my professional development and stick with me throughout my career in tech. I’d also have the chance to show that i'm a quick learner and can adapt to the ever changing nature of software development. </p>

        <h3 class="hthree">To challenge myself</h3>
        <p class="subh">Taking what i've taught myself into a proffessional environment will present an exciting challenge, putting my problem solving and teamwork skills to the test whilst also giving me the push myself and step up my learning in order to meet expectations. All of this would prepare me for working as a full time developer</p>
