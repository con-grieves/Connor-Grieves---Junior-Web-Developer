              I currently work part time as a barista and spend my remaining hours sat infront of my laptop lapping up as much <br />
              coding know-how as i can manage and absolutely loving every second of it.</p>

            <h3 id="journey-subtitle">Where i started</h3>
            <p>I'd spent 2 years studying physics at university and simply not enjoying it, i concluded that it wasn't for me and not where i wanted to take my career, i wasn't enjoying the content
              and i'd be spending increasingly more time helping a flat mate with his programming modules, i began learning that material almost addictively, i was obsessed ! I'd
              developed a huge passion for it over the few months i'd been learning and i knew thats where i wanted to be career wise. After considering my options and looking into junior roles and apprenticeships in
              web development i made the leap and withdrew from my studies, got a part time job in retail and began teaching myself HTML and CSS. I enrolled into an online web development course on udemy and have been transfixed ever
              since !
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12" id="journey-col">
            <img class="mx-auto" src="images/computer.png" alt="" id="comp">
            <h3 id="journey-subtitle">Where i am now</h3>
            <p>Still learning ! I've been studying HTML and CSS and have just began incorporating bootstrap into my projects.
              I try to spend around 5-6 hours a day reading up material and applying it into little projects such as this site. I'm progressing through the online
              course at my own pace and am currently studying bootstrap and responsive design and it's been amazing, integrating bootstrap into this site was a fun problem to solve as i'd developed the site using pure css initialy, but once it was
              done i was amazed at how
              powerful bootstrap is, especially for layout. I'm enjoying getting to grips with coding langauges immensely and want to take the extra step
              and get my foot in the door in industry, i'm very <em>very</em> excited to get started !
            </p>

            <h3 id="journey-subtitle">Where i want to be</h3>
            <p><em>Still learning.</em> I don't expect to ever stop learning whilst pursuing this career path, it's constantly developing and adpatation is key to staying upto-date with technology trends. Software and web development is where my passion
              lies
              and learning a multitude of coding langauges from javascript and jQuery to java and C++ whilst working alongside seasoned developers is exactly why
              this apprenticeship is exactly what i'm looking for; It's such a brilliant oppurtunity for me to kickstart my passion into an actual career and it's even close to home.
              My long-term goal is to continue pursuing software development and land a job within a team as a junior dev, working my way up and learning as i go.
