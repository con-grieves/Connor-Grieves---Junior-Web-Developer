            <h3 id="journey-subtitle">Where i started</h3>
            <p>I'd spent 2 years studying physics at university and simply not enjoying it, i concluded that it wasn't for me and not where i wanted to take my career, i wasn't enjoying the content
              and i'd be spending increasingly more time helping a flat mate with his programming modules, i began learning that material almost addictively, i was obsessed ! I'd
              developed a huge passion for it over the few months i'd been learning and i knew thats where i wanted to be career wise. After considering my options and looking into junior roles and apprenticeships in
              web development i made the leap and withdrew from my studies, got a part time job in retail and began teaching myself HTML and CSS. I enrolled into an online Web Development course on udemy and have been transfixed ever
              since !
            </p>

            <img class="mx-auto" src="images/computer.png" alt="" id="comp">
            <h3 id="journey-subtitle">Where i am now</h3>
            <p>Still learning ! I've studied HTML and CSS and have been learning javascript for a while now with plans to move into react once i'm familiar with base js, i've developed my own dice game as a project to put what i've learned into practice at this early stage which you can see<a class="" href="https://con-grieves.github.io/Dice/" target="_blank"><i></i> Here.</a>  it's a much deeper topic than to two previous langauges but i'm loving it so far, i've invested in an online course
              and a number of textbooks on the topic.
              I try to spend around 5-6 hours a day reading up material and applying it into little projects such as this site. I'm enjoying getting to grips with coding langauges and want to take the next step
              and get my foot in the door in industry, i'm very <em>very</em> excited to get started !
            </p>

            <h3 id="journey-subtitle">Where i want to be</h3>
            <p><em>Still learning.</em> I don't expect to ever stop learning whilst pursuing this career path, it's constantly developing and adpatation is key to staying upto-date with technology trends. Software and web development is where my passion
              lies
              and learning a multitude of coding langauges from javascript and jQuery to java and C++ whilst working alongside seasoned developers is exactly why
               i'm so excited to begin my journey and kickstart my passion into an actual career.
              My long-term goal is to continue pursuing software development and land a job within a team as a junior dev, working my way up and learning as i go.
