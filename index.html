            <h3 id="journey-subtitle">Where i started</h3>
            <p>After spending 2 years studying physics at university i concluded that it wasn't where i wanted to take my career, i was enjoying the content but knew that it wasn't for me in the long run
              and i'd be spending increasingly more time helping a friend with his programming modules, i began learning that almost addictively! I'd
              developed a huge passion for it over the few months i'd been learning and i knew thats where i wanted to be career wise. After considering my options and looking into junior roles and apprenticeships in
              web development i made the leap and withdrew from my studies, got a part time job in retail and began teaching myself HTML and CSS. I bought an online Web Development course and have been transfixed ever
              since !
            </p>

            <img class="mx-auto" src="images/computer.png" alt="" id="comp">
            <h3 id="journey-subtitle">Where i am now</h3>
            <p>Still learning ! I've been studying HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and vanilla javascript with a little bit of React exposure. I've built a simple dice game as a project to put what i've learned in JS into practice which you can
               see<a class="" href="https://con-grieves.github.io/Dice/" target="_blank"><i></i> Here.</a> I'm loving it and have invested in a number of online courses on the topic to take my learning further. i plan to delve into the SASS framework aswell as 
               spending more time learning React and how it can be used to streamline the front end workflow.
              I try to spend as much time as i can studying via online courses and applying what i learn into little projects such as this site. I'm keen to take the next step
              and get my foot in the door in a professional environment, i'm very <em>very</em> excited to get started !
            </p>

            <h3 id="journey-subtitle">Where i want to be</h3>
            <p><em>Still learning.</em> I don't expect to ever stop learning whilst pursuing this career path, it's constantly developing and i understand that adpatation is key to staying upto-date with technology trends. Web development is where my passion
              lies
              and learning more about langauges such as the javascript stack including React and Node.js whilst working alongside seasoned developers is exactly why
               i'm so excited to begin my journey and kickstart my passion into a career.
              My long-term goal is to continue pursuing Web Development and land a job within a team as a junior dev, working my way up and learning as i go, diving headfirst into growing myself as a web developer.
